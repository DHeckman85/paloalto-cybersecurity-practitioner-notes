# Describe application allow listing

Application allow listing is a control model where applications must be permitted by policy to be installed or ran. A list of approved applications are curated and maintained and prevents any applications not on the list from running. 

Some drawbacks relate to the models of computing used today. Particularly BYOD/BYOA make enforcement difficult due to lack of control of some endpoints. Furthermore, all software is vulnerable and while allow listing the application may help control attack surface, bugs or errors in the software still allow attackers to breach an endpoint and allowing software is not a guarantee it is secure. Malware may run in the same process and memory space as the allowed application making this mitigation technique moot.
