# Goal - Explain the limitations of signature-based anti-malware software

Signature based anti malware has several disadvantages including
- Slow Countermeasure Response
	- Signatures must be observed in the wild and a rule written
- Performance Degradation
	- Performance of the endpoint may be noticeable due to downloading and installing the updates to keep signature based solutions current.
- Window of Opportunity
	- During the time it takes to develop the signature and apply the signature means that a threat is active on your network for much longer than what may be desired
- Variations of the malware require significant re-work
- Evasion techniques allow the malware to evade detection and bypass current protections
