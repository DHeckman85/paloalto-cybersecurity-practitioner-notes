These notes are laid out according to the blueprint. Each section will correspond to a section of the blueprint with subsections and subsections of subsections clearly denoted. 

Labeling is a rough idea of the topic and does not have the "verb" such as describe, apply, identify, etc. Instead the first header explains the goal of the section and corresponding notes.

Files are held in their own folder that can be linked to as needed. External links are clearly marked as such while internal links are not marked as external.
