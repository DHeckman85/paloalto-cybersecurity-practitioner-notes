# Goal - Describe container architecture

Containers are packages of software that allow them to run independently within a host operating system. Container images run in the kernel namespace of the host operating system and contain all of the software necessary to run without any needs from the host operating system. 

Containers run in isolation and are highly portable due to the dependencies being included into the container image. This means that a container can be run from any host that supports container workloads without any special needs or considerations of the hosting OS. 

Containers run on a container engine. Examples of container engines include
- Docker
- CRI-O
- Railcar
- RKT
- LXC

Security considerations to make with container architecture is the ecosystem that supports it which include:
- Images
- Containers
- Hosts
- Runtimes
- Registries
- Orchestration Platforms

Containers can scale thanks to orchestration engines such as:
- Kubernetes (CNCF)
- Rancher (SUSE)
- Nomad (Hashicorp)
- Mesos (Apache)
- Openshift (RedHat)

These orchestration layers allow users to manage infrastructure at scale through APIs that allow you to deploy and manage the container life cycle; From deployment to tear down.
